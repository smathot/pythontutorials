## About this course

In this course, you will learn the basic principles of data science with Python. That is, you will learn how to work with the most important Python libraries for numerical computing, to work with different kinds of data (arrays, column-based data, and time series), to create plots, and to perform statistical analyses.

## Installing required packages

Before you get started, you need to install several libraries that you will use (either directly or indirectly) during the course. You can do this with `pip`:

```text
pip install numpy scipy matplotlib seaborn statsmodels pandas pingouin datamatrix prettytable fastnumbers openpyxl
```

Or with `conda`:

```text
conda install numpy scipy matplotlib seaborn statsmodels pandas pingouin datamatrix prettytable fastnumbers openpyxl
```
