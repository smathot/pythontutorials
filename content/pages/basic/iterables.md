## Iterables, order, and mutability

In Python, an *iterable* object (or simply an *iterable*) is a collection of elements that you can loop (or *iterate*) through one element at a time. Simply put, an iterable is a list-like object. There are many kinds of iterables, which differ in many ways, including whether they are ordered and mutable:

- An iterable is *ordered* if you can retrieve its elements in a *predictable order*
- An iterable is *mutable* if you can change which elements it contains

Python has four built-in iterable types: `list`, `dict`, `tuple`, and `set`


## list: an ordered, mutable collection of elements

A `list` consists of zero or more other elements in a fixed order. The elements of a `list` can be anything, such a numbers (`int`), strings (`str`), and even other `list`s. Different elements from the same `list` can have different types.

A `list` is defined as a comma-separated list of values between square brackets:


```python
prime_numbers = [1, 3, 5, 7, 11]
print(prime_numbers)
```


### Getting a single element (indexing)

To get a single element from a `list`, use the *index* (position) of the element, where `0` is the first element, `1` is the second element, etc. That is, Python uses [zero-based indexing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zero-based_numbering). You can also count from the end of the `list` by using a negative index, where `-1` is the last element, `-2`, is the second-to-last element, etc.


```python
print('Prime at index 0: {0}'.format(prime_numbers[0]))
print('Prime at index 1: {0}'.format(prime_numbers[1]))
print('Prime at index -4: {0}'.format(prime_numbers[-4]))
```


### Getting a range of elements (slicing)

You can also get multiple elements from a `list` by specifying a *slice*.


```python
letters = ['a', 'b', 'c', 'd', 'e', 'f', 'g']
from_index = 0
to_index = 4 # Non-inclusive, so until and including 'd' (at index 3)
in_steps_of = 3
print(letters[from_index:to_index:in_steps_of])
```

All the parts of a slice are optional, and fall back to the start of the list (for `from_index`), the end of the list (for `to_index`), and steps of 1. So you can get the first two prime numbers by only specifying the `to_index`, like this:


```python
print(prime_numbers[:2])
```

A common way to create a copy of a list to get the *full slice*. (This is equivalent to `list.copy()` in Python 3.)

```python
my_copy = prime_numbers[:]
```


### len(): counting the number of elements

`len()` counts how many elements there are in a `list`, or more generally in any iterable that has a length. (Some special iterables have no length, for example because they correspond to an infinite series. However, all iterables that we consider here have a length.)


```python
n = len(prime_numbers)
print('We have defined {0} prime numbers'.format(n))
```


### in: checking whether an iterable contains an element

Python has a special operator, `in`, to check whether an element is part of a `list` or another iterable.


```python
if 3 in prime_numbers:
    print('Three is prime')
```


### Modifying a list

A `list` has several common functions for adding or removing elements:

- `list.append(element)` adds an element to the end
- `list.insert(index, element)` inserts an element at position `index`
- `element = list.pop()` removes the last element from the list and returns it


```python
prime_numbers = []
prime_numbers.append(1)
prime_numbers.append(3) # Etc.
print(prime_numbers)
```

## dict: an unordered, mutable collection of key-value pairs

A `dict` consists of zero or more key-value pairs. That is, each element of a `dict` is a combination of a value that serves as a key and that is associated with another value. A `dict` is *unordered*, which means that if you iterate through the elements of a `dict`, you are not guaranteed to get the elements in a particular order. So never rely on the order of a `dict`!

A `dict` supports `len()` and `in`, as described above for `list`s. However, indexing a `dict` works differently from a `list`, as discussed below, and slicing is not supported.

A `dict` is defined as a comma-separated list of key : value mappings between curly braces.


```python
ages = {
    'Jay-Z': 47,
    'Emanuel Macron': 40
}

print(ages)
```


### Getting a single element (indexing)

If you want to get an elements from a `dict`, you do this by specifying a `key`.


```python
print('Jay-Z is {0} years old'.format(ages['Jay-Z']))
```


Alternatively, you can use `dict.get()`, which allows you to specify a default value in case the key is not in the `dict`.


```python
print(
  'Johnny Depp is {0} years old'.format(
    ages.get('Johnny Depp', 'unknown')
  )
)
```


## tuple: an ordered, immutable collection of elements

The `tuple` is very similar to a `list`. The main difference between the two types is that a `tuple` is *immutable*, which means that a `tuple` cannot be changed after it has been defined; in other words, there are no functions such as `tuple.append()`, `tuple.pop()`, etc.

A `tuple` supports indexing, slicing, `len()` and `in`, as described above for `list`s.

A `tuple` is defined as a comma-separated list of values, optionally surrounded by parentheses.


```python
fibonacci = 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8
# Parentheses are optional unless they are required to avoid ambiguity
fibonacci = (1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8)
```


## set: an unordered, mutable collection of unique elements

The `set` is a somewhat unusual type, which you will rarely use unless you're doing mathematical computations. A `set` corresponds to a mathematical set as specified in [set theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Set_theory).

A `set` supports `len()` and `in`, as described above for `list`s. However, a `set` does not support indexing or slicing.

A `set` is defined as a comma-separated list of values surrounded by curly braces.

```python
vowels = {'a', 'e', 'i', 'o', 'u'}
```

A characteristic feature of `set`s is that each element can occur at most once (duplicates are ignored):

```python
print({'a', 'e'} == {'a', 'a', 'e', 'e'})
```

The `set` also supports standard operations from set theory:

- The union (`|`) of two sets contains all elements that occur in either or both of the sets
- The intersection (`&`) of two sets contains all elements that occur in both sets

```python
vowels_1 = {'a', 'e', 'i'}
vowels_2 = {'i', 'o', 'u'}
print('Union: {0}'.format(vowels_1 | vowels_2))
print('Intersection: {0}'.format(vowels_1 & vowels_2))
```
