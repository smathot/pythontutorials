## The Python standard library

So far, we've only used functions that are built into Python, and that you can use straight away when you start a Python interpreter. However, you can `import` modules to get additional functionality. Many common modules are included in Python by default so that you don't need to install themâ€”but you do have to `import` them! These modules make up the Python standard library:

- <https://docs.python.org/3/library/index.html>


## `import`: importing modules

Let's consider the `random` module:

- <https://docs.python.org/3/library/random.html>

The `random` module contains many functions for randomization. For example, `random.choice()` takes an iterable, such as a `list`, and returns a single, randomly selected element. To use `random.choice()`, you need to `import` the `random` module.


```python
# Preferred
import random
prime_numbers = [1, 3, 5, 7, 11]
print(random.choice(prime_numbers))
```

In the example above, you import the entire `random` module and then selectively call `random.choice()`. However, the `import` statement is flexible and allows you to import modules and functions in many different ways. These all have their place, but as a general rule, the `import` method shown above is clearest and therefore preferred.


<div class="exercise" id="exercise_import" markdown="1">
#### Mini exercise

Import the `string` module, and print out [all ASCII letters](https://docs.python.org/3/library/string.html#string.ascii_letters) as defined in this module.

<textarea class="code"></textarea>
<div hidden class="solution_output">abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyzABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ</div>
</div>

You can also selectively import the `choice()` function. The downside of this way of importing is that you cannot easily tell anymore that `choice()` is part of the `random` module.


```python
# Not preferred
from random import choice
print(choice(prime_numbers))
```

<div class="exercise" id="exercise_import_from" markdown="1">
#### Mini exercise

Selectively import the `sample()` function from the `random` module, and the `ascii_letters` attribute of the `string` module. Use these to randomly sample five letters and assign these to a variable called `five_letters`.

<textarea class="code"></textarea>
<div hidden class="solution_validate">
import random
import string
correct = 1
try:
    if random.sample is not sample:
        correct = 0
    if string.ascii_letters is not ascii_letters:
        correct = 0
    if len(five_letters) != 5:
        correct = 0
except:
    correct = 0
</div>
</div>


You can also directly import everything from the `random` module: a *wildcard* import. This is generally considered bad practice, because it makes it difficult to tell where a function comes from.


```python
# Not preferred
from random import *
print(choice(prime_numbers))
```

Finally, the `import` statement allows you to rename the imported modules or functions. Again, this is generally not preferred because of potential confusion. Exceptions are libraries such as `numpy` for which an import-and-rename (`import numpy as np`) is so common that it is unlikely to result in confusion.


```python
# Not preferred
import random as rnd
print(rnd.choice(prime_numbers))
```

## Installing additional modules with pip

There are also many modules that are not part of the Python standard library, that is, modules that are not included with Python by default. Fortunately, it's easy to install these additional modules with `pip`, the __P__ackage __I__nstaller for __P__ython. `pip` installs packages from the Python Package Index, or PyPI, which is like an app-store for Python packages. Almost every Python package that exists is available from there:

- <https://pypi.org/>

`pip` is a command-line that is included with Python. If you're using a code editor with a Python environment, such as Rapunzel or Spyder, the easiest to call pip is simply by entering a `pip` command in the Python console. (This works because the code editor recognizes that a `pip` command is not Python code, but rather a call to the `pip` application.)

To install a package, simply execute `pip install` followed by the name of the package. For example, to install [DataMatrix](%url:datamatrix%), a package for working with tabular data, which you may meet later in the data-science course, run:

```
pip install datamatrix
```
