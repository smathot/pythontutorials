Congratulations, you're about to learn Python!

[Python](http://www.python.org/) is a widely used programming language that is intuitive and easy to learn. From researchers to independent developers to large companies such as Facebook and DropBox: they all rely on Python. And for good reasons.

The goal of this website is to provide an accessible introduction to Python for beginners.

If you do not have a Python environment set up yet (or don't even know what this means!) then let's first:

- [Get started](%url:get-started%)

Once you're all set up, dive right in with one of the __basic tutorials__:

1. [Syntax](%url:syntax%)
2. [Iterables: list, dict, tuple, and set](%url:iterables%)
3. [Loops: for and while](%url:loops%)
4. [Functions](%url:functions%)
5. [Modules](%url:modules%)
6. [Exceptions: error handling](%url:exceptions%)

Or do you want to learn about __numerical computing__ with Python?

1. [NumPy](%url:numpy%)
2. [DataMatrix](%url:datamatrix%)
3. [Plotting with Seaborn and Matplotlib](%url:plotting%)
4. [Statistics with SciPy and Statsmodels](%url:statistics%)

Or perhaps you're interested in __deep learning__ in Python with Keras?

1. [Introduction to deep learning](%url:introduction%)
2. [Building a basic neural network](%url:basics%)
3. [Classifying images with MobileNetV2](%url:image-classification%)
4. [Customizing MobileNet v2 with transfer learning](%url:transfer-learning%)

Or do you prefer to sit back, watch, and learn?
