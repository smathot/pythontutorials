Take the datamatrix (`sm`) that you have constructed during this chapter. During the period that this dataset spans, two major crises occurred: the the 2008 financial crisis and the 2020 corona crisis.

First, quantify the impact of both crises on the per-capita GDP of each country. For the 2008 financial crisis, the impact can be quantified as the difference between per-capita GDP in 2009 and 2007. For the corona crisis, the impact can be quantified as the difference between 2020 and 2019.

Next, create a scatter plot with the 2008-crisis impact on the x-axis, the corona-crisis impact on the y-axis, and individual countries as points. Draw dotted black lines (one horizontal and one vertical) through the 0 points for both axes. Draw solid red lines (one horizontal and one vertical) to indicate the mean impact of each crisis across countries.
